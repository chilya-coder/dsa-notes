# Two Pointers

This pattern is typically used in **sorted array** to compare pairs.

**Merge Sorted Array (88):**
2 pointers are used. However, here we use **Reverse Two Pointers** technique from the **end/tail** to insert values on correct positions and not override others.
Don't forget to merge remaining tail of the second array to the first one.
